# swiftstats
Statistics for swift &mdash; v1.3.0

Modification to trigger a Travis test.

## Features
### Distributions
Currently the following distributions are included: 
- Normal
- Log-normal
- Bernoulli 
- Laplace 
- Poisson
- Uniform
- Geometric
- Exponential
- Binomial

And each distribution has these methods:
- pmf or pdf
- cdf
- quantile
- random (takes an optional int and returns an array of that length, or otherwise a single value) 

### Common Functions
- median (`Int`, `Float`, `Double`)
- mean (`Int`, `Float`, `Double`)
- erf<sup>-1</sup> (implemented as `erfinv`, whereas `erf` is implemented as part of `Foundation`)
- least squares regression; lsr ([[`Double`]]) -> [`Double`, `Double`]



## Building

There are two options for building SwiftStats; you can use Carthage to build and update the framework for you, or you can manually clone SwiftStats from GitHub and build it yourself. 

### Building with Carthage

Using Carthage to manage to build process and to update the framework is the ideal option for those who wish to use the latest stable version of SwiftStats.

First, ensure that [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is installed.  Using Terminal, navigate to your project's directory.  Edit or add a the file named `Cartfile`.  The contents should include the line

    github "r0fls/swiftstats"

From Terminal, run the command 

    carthage update

This will download the latest stable release and build the framework.

Next, follow the [rest of the instructions](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#getting-started).


### Manual Build

Using the manual build process is ideal for those who want the latest (not necessarily stable) version.  It's especially relevant for those who would like to contribute.

From Terminal, clone the repo using the command:
    
    git clone https://github.com/r0fls/swiftstats.git
    
In Xcode, open the project file `SwiftStats.xcodeproj`.  Select a target, and compile by selecting Product > Build.
    

## Testing

 Open the project (top level directory for the entire repo) in Xcode. The repo includes a playground, which has all of the examples from the unit tests. You can run the unit tests in Xcode (Product > Test), or by opening a terminal, changing to the directory of the repo, and typing:

    xcodebuild test -scheme SwiftStats

## Example Usage

To print a random number that is normally distributed with a mean of 0 and a variance of 1:

```swift

import SwiftStats

let  n = SwiftStats.Distributions.Normal(0, 1.0)
print(n.random())
```

To print a random number that is normally distributed, with parameters based on previous samples:

```swift

import SwiftStats

let n = SwiftStats.Distributions.Normal([0,-1,1,0])
print(n.random())
```

To find the median of some data:

```swift
import SwiftStats
SwiftStats.Common.median([1,4,3,2]) // -> 2.5
SwiftStats.Common.median([3,1,2]) // -> 2
```

### Advanced
You can seed the random variable by using the distributions's seed method (or calling `srand48()` directly), or leave it to use the default seed:
```swift
n = Normal(0, 1.0)
// default randomly seeded variable
print(n.random())
// using the distributions' seed method
n.seed(42)
print(n.random())
// using srand48() directly
srand48(1)
print(n.random())
```

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute, please submit a pull request, or raise an issue.

### TO-DO
- add more distributions
- allow updating a fitted distribution with more data
- pass travis tests without mangling the median function
- add targets (iOS, watch)
- other stuff
